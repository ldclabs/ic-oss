## Who's using?

- [dMsg.net](https://dmsg.net): The world's 1st decentralized end-to-end encrypted messaging application fully running on the Internet Computer blockchain. dMsg.net uses IC-OSS to store user avatars (public), channel logos and encrypted files (private).
- [Anda](https://github.com/ldclabs/anda): An AI agent framework built with Rust, powered by ICP and TEEs. Anda uses `ic_object_store_canister` to store AI memory states.

If you plan to use this project and have any questions, feel free to open an issue. I will address it as soon as possible.

## Integration

![IC-OSS Sequence](./ic-oss-sequence.webp)

1. Dapp backend: Configure access control via `ic_oss_cluster`
2. Dapp frontend: Obtain `access_token` using `ic-oss-ts` SDK
3. Dapp frontend: Use token to interact with `ic_oss_bucket`

## Examples

- [examples/ai_canister](https://github.com/ldclabs/ic-oss/tree/main/examples/ai_canister): A Rust demonstration project used to show how to implement large file storage in the ICP canister by using `ic-oss-can`.
- [examples/upload_js](https://github.com/ldclabs/ic-oss/tree/main/examples/upload_js): A Javascript demonstration project used to show how to upload files to ic_oss_bucket canister by using `@ldclabs/ic_oss_ts`.
- [examples/video_player](https://github.com/ldclabs/ic-oss/tree/main/examples/video_player): A video player website to test HTTP range request.
